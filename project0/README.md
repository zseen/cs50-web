My project is about four types of British pig breeds.

Content:
- index.html: lists the four breeds with links to their own html pages, and compares their looks in a table.
- gloucester.html, tamworth.html, saddleback.html, berkshire.html: describes each breed with a link to their own Wikipedia page, and provides a link to a guide about pig breeds; these html sites also contain a "Back" button to navigate back to index.html
