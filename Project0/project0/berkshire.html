<p id="Berkshire" class="pigs">The original Berkshire pig was reddish or sandy-brown, sometimes with spots.
    In the 1700s, breeders made improvements by cross-breeding the Berkshire with a Chinese and Siamese pig.
    This is when the breed took on the distinctive entirely black color, with white on the feet, nose, and tail.
