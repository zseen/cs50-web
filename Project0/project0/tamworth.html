        <p class="pigs">Tamworth pigs are very efficient at excavation while rooting for food in the forest or pasture. The breed is used in forage-based farming systems. The sows demonstrate good maternal skills, being consistent in suckling all littermates. Litters normally range in size from six to ten piglets. Piglets at birth are usually wild and wary of humans, but easily adjust to human interaction. Tamworths display a good disposition and enjoy the attention of humans.</p>

        <p class="pigs">Considered one of Britain's oldest pig breeds, the Tamworth has a ginger coat, elongated snout and long legs. Now considered as a vulnerable breed by the Rare Breed Survival Trust, the Tamworth's numbers have fallen in recent years with less than 300 breeding sows registered in Britain.</p>
